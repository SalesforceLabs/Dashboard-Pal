Additional Details:

The lightning component enables the user to choose a dashboard from a list of available folders in the org, upon selecting a dashboard this dashboard is saved for current user, replacing the default dashboard for that user in order to avoid having that user having to select a dashboard every time, therefore making the user interaction persistent.
